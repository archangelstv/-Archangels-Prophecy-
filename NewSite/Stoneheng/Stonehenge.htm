<p><span class=rvts4>As I entered the center the light became very apparent. It was a bluish white light pointing skyward from a large stone on the ground.

I stayed there and watched as someone left this world. I understood then. Afterward I left Stonehenge. As I say Stonehenge was completed and it was on a very dark night. I could not tell if this was in another dimension or this one, but I believe it was in the next one above this one.</span></p>
