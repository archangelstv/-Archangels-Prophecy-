              **It's the Camel Not the Burro**

It's the camel not the burro
They take the burro, the camel walks away
The meaning is obscured, but true

Israel and Trump take their turn
This sets the stage

He takes it to a new location
Where it can do the most good
One leader is killed, the other get's his way

He looks closer on the few

His name is Isis, his view is on one thing

He pays much for it

It's on the Camel
No one knows it's there

Then when the time is right

Israel finds their demise

America blames the wrong one

Then Retribution

No one on our side can believe the Americans are so dumb

They are either dead or greatly saddened 

They are placed in the Sun

There is no forgiveness

The New World is born
